## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
steak <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/refs/heads/master/steak-survey/steak-risk-survey.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

View(steak)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
print("placeholder")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
